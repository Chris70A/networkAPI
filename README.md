## Description

This project is a Social Network API that allows users to interact with a NoSQL database for sharing thoughts, reacting to friends' thoughts, and creating a friend list.

- The goal of this project was to build an API for a social network that can deal with a lot of unstructured data because this is something that is frequently needed in real-world applications.
- The goal of this project was to show off the power of NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB, and how they can work together with Node.js and Express.js to build a highly scalable and adaptable backend for web applications.
- The API offers a solution for handling detailed user interactions on social media sites, including adding, changing, and removing people, ideas, emotions, and friend connections.
- Building this project allowed for the gain of knowledge about using MongoDB, Mongoose ODM, and carrying out CRUD operations on a NoSQL database.
